      ### Meen Motors' Sales Strategy:
      - **Direct Sales**: Initially, Meen Motors will sell directly to customers through their website and experience centers. The plan is to open one specific experience center in Bangalore in the first year. This experience centre is not a dealership but a place where customers can experience the car and the brand. Think Roman countryside and a villa with a vintage car in the driveway.
      - **Partnerships**: Meen Motors will partner with luxury hotels, resorts, product brands, and event companies to provide exclusive experiences to potential customers. The goal is to create a buzz around the brand and the car.
      - **Digital Marketing**: Meen Motors will focus on digital marketing to reach potential customers. The company will use social media, influencers, and online ads to create brand awareness and generate leads. The focus will be on creating a lifestyle brand around the car. Word of mouth and exclusivity will be key to the marketing strategy.
      - **Customer Experience**: Meen Motors will focus on providing a unique and personalized customer experience. The goal is to make the customer feel special and part of an exclusive club. The company will offer concierge services (powered by Star at the first level), exclusive events, and personalized experiences to customers.
      - **Pricing Strategy**: Meen Motors will position the car as a premium product and price it accordingly. The goal is to create a perception of exclusivity and luxury around the car. The company will focus on creating a premium brand image and will not engage in price wars with competitors. The focus will be on value and experience rather than price.

      ### Meen Motors' Operations and Production Strategy:
      - **Production**: Meen Motors will set up an assembly unit in India to produce the cars. The company will focus on quality and craftsmanship in production. The goal is not volume but is to create a high-quality product that meets the expectations of the customers. Initially, the focus will only be on assembly in-house with parts sourced from suppliers and OEMs. These parts are custom designed by us but manufactured by suppliers to keep our up-front costs low.
      - **Supply Chain**: Meen Motors will work with suppliers and OEMs to source parts for the car. The company will focus on building long-term relationships with suppliers to ensure quality and reliability. The goal is to create a supply chain that is efficient, cost-effective, and consistent.
      - **Focus on USP and strengths**: The team will focus on developing the base technology and design in-house while outsourcing manufacturing and assembly to keep costs low.
      - **Quality Control**: Meen Motors will focus on in-house quality control at every stage of production. The company will have a dedicated team to ensure that every car meets the quality standards set by the company.
